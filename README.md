# TaskProgressTracker
A **TaskProgressTracker** is a tool that helps monitor how far a task has gone and whatâ€™s happening with it or what's need to be done. It shows things like how much is done, whether the task is still running, finished, or failed, and what step it's on. It's useful for long tasks so users or systems can see progress and know when something is complete or needs attention.
